## Bit Manipulation
# Synopsis
Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. 

In this Project, we learn howw to:
* convert a binary number to an unsigned int.
* print the binary representation of a number.
* returns the value of a bit at a given index.
* write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
* write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
* write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
